OSC Groups can send data from any OSC-capable application to all applications which are connected to a group.

In this way, performers can perform locally or remotely by sharing any type of control data (eg. from MIDI devices ore sensors), but also code, live over the network.

<h3 class="text-center">More about OSC Groups</h3>


OSC Groups can send data from any OSC-capable application to all applications which are connected to a group.  In this way, performers can share any type of control data (eg. from MIDI devices, sensors, or other osc-capable devices), but also code between their computers over the network while performing.

<p>
<p>
	OSC Groups is application agnostic: Any application that can send or receive OSC, as for example SuperCollider, Max/MSP, and Pure Data, can participate in a networked performance in this way.

<p>

With <a href="https://github.com/iani/sc-hacks-redux">sc-hacks-redux</a>, users can send the code which they run locally on their SuperCollider to all other SuperCollider users connected to an OSC Group.
